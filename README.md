# Pointless to Lua transpiler
This transpiler is an implementation of a declarative and functional programming lanuage named (Pointless)[https://github.com/pointless-lang/pointless/]. It compiles that to Lua. Currently it points you to the file, line and character you got an error from, while not displaying text of the file.
